Our hypertopology provides an analogue of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance on proper metric spaces, and in fact, convergence in the latter implies convergence in the former. Moreover, when restricted to the class of quantum compact metric spaces, our new topology is compatible with the topology of the Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity. We include new examples of noncompact, noncommutative pointed proper quantum metric spaces which are limits, for our new topology, of finite dimensional quantum compact metric spaces. This article thus provides a first answer to the challenging question of how to extend noncommutative metric geometry to the locally compact quantum space realm.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11715v1'>Continuity for the spectral propinquity of the Dirac operators associated with an analytic path of Riemannian metrics</a>,<br>Carla Farsi, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Latr&eacute;moli&egrave;re,  <i>Submitted</i>, ArXiv: <a class='arxiva' href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11715v1'>2504.11715v1</a><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p style='text-align: justify'>We prove that a polynomial path of Riemannian metrics on a closed spin manifold induces a continuous field in the spectral propinquity of metric spectral triples.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00240v3'>Collapse in Noncommutative Geometry and Spectral Continuity</a>,<br>Carla Farsi, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Latr&eacute;moli&egrave;re,  <i>Submitted</i>, ArXiv: <a class='arxiva' href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00240v3'>2404.00240v3</a><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p style='text-align: justify'>If two compact quantum metric spaces are close in the metric sense, then how similar are they, as noncommutative spaces? In the classical realm of Riemannian geometry, informally, if two manifolds are close in the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, and belong to a class of manifolds with bounded curvature and diameter, then the spectra of their Laplacian or Dirac operators are also close under many scenari. Of particular interest is the case where a sequence of manifolds converge for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance to a manifold of lower dimension, and the question of the continuity, in some sense, of the spectra of geometrically relevant operators. In this paper, we initiate the study of the continuity of spectra and other properties of metric spectral triples under collapse in the noncommutative realm. As a first step in this study, we work with collapse for the spectral propinquity, an analogue of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance for spectral triples introduced by the second author, i.e. a form of metric for differential structures. Inspired by results from collapse in Riemannian geometry, we begin with the study of spectral triples which decompose, in some sense, in a vertical and a horizontal direction, and we collapse these spectral triples along the vertical direction. We obtain convergence results, and by the work of the second author, we conclude continuity results for the spectra of the Dirac operators of these spectral triples. Examples include collapse of product of spectral triples with one Abelian factor, $U(1)$ principal bundles over Riemannian spin manifolds, and noncommutative principal bundles, including C*-crossed-products and other noncommutative bundles.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16323v1'>Spectral Triples on noncommutative solenoids from the standard spectral triples on quantum tori</a>,<br>Carla Farsi, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Latr&eacute;moli&egrave;re, Judith Packer,  <i>Submitted</i>, ArXiv: <a class='arxiva' href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16323v1'>2403.16323v1</a><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p style='text-align: justify'>We address the natural question: as noncommutative solenoids are inductive limits of quantum tori, do the standard spectral triples on quantum tori converge to some spectral triple on noncommutative solenoid for the spectral propinquity?

This condition is easy to verify in many examples, such as quantum compact metric spaces associated to AF algebras or certain twisted convolution C*-algebras of discrete inductive limit groups. Our condition also implies the convergence of an inductive sequence of spectral triples in the sense of the spectral propinquity, a generalization of the Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity on quantum compact metric spaces to the space of metric spectral triples. In particular we show the convergence of the state spaces of the underlying C*-algebras as quantum compact metric spaces, and also the convergence of the quantum dynamics induced by the Dirac operators in the spectral triples. We apply these results to new classes of inductive limit of even spectral triples on noncommutative solenoids and Bunce-Deddens C*-algebras. Our construction, which involves length functions with bounded doubling, adds geometric information and highlights the structure of these twisted C*-algebras as inductive limits.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00523v1'>Estimating the Jacobian matrix of an unknown multivariate function from sample values by means of a neural network</a>,<br>Frédéric Latrémolière, Sadananda Narayanappa, Petr Vojtěchovský,  <i>Submitted</i>, ArXiv: <a class='arxiva' href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00523v1'>2204.00523v1</a><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p style='text-align: justify'>We describe, implement and test a novel method for training neural networks to estimate the Jacobian matrix $J$ of an unknown multivariate function $F$. The training set is constructed from finitely many pairs $(x,F(x))$ and it contains no explicit information about $J$. The loss function for backpropagation is based on linear approximations and on a nearest neighbor search in the sample data. We formally establish an upper bound on the uniform norm of the error, in operator norm, between the estimated Jacobian matrix provided by the algorithm and the actual Jacobian matrix, under natural assumptions on the function, on the training set and on the loss of the neural network during training.
  The Jacobian matrix of a multivariate function contains a wealth of information about the function and it has numerous applications in science and engineering. The method given here represents a step in moving from black-box approximations of functions by neural networks to approximations that provide some structural information about the function in question.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11000v3'>Continuity of the Spectrum of Dirac Operators of Spectral Triples for the Spectral Propinquity</a>,<br>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Latr&eacute;moli&egrave;re,  <i>Math.

We prove in this paper that if a sequence of metric spectral triples converges for the propinquity, then the spectra of the Dirac operators for these triples do converge to the spectrum of the Dirac operator at the limit. We obtain this result by first proving that, in an appropriate sense induced by some natural metric, the bounded, continuous functional calculi defined by the Dirac operators also converge. As an application of our work, we see, in particular, that action functionals of a wide class of metric spectral triples are continuous for the spectral propinquity, which clearly connects convergence for the spectral propinquity with the applications of noncommutative geometry to mathematical physics. This fact is a consequence of results on the continuity of the multiplicity of eigenvalues of Dirac operators. In particular, we formalize convergence of adjoinable operators of different C*-correspondences, endowed with appropriate quantum metric data.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03729v4'>Convergence of Spectral Triples on Fuzzy Tori to Spectral Triples on Quantum Tori</a>,<br>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Latr&eacute;moli&egrave;re,  <i>Comm.

We prove in this paper that we can construct spectral triples on fuzzy tori which, as the dimension grow to infinity and under other natural conditions, converge to a natural spectral triple on quantum tori, in the sense of the spectral propinquity. This provides a formal assertion that indeed, fuzzy tori approximate quantum tori, not only as quantum metric spaces, but as noncommutative differentiable manifolds -- including convergence of the state spaces as metric spaces and of the quantum dynamics generated by the Dirac operators of the spectral triples, in an appropriate sense.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06921v2'>Metric Approximations of Spectral Triples on the Sierpiński Gasket and other fractal curves</a>,<br>Therese-Marie Landry, Michel L.

Many fractals are constructed as natural limits of certain sets with a simpler structure: for instance, the Sierpiński is the limit of finite graphs consisting of various affine images of an equilateral triangle. It is thus natural to ask whether the spectral triples, constructed on a class of fractals called piecewise $C^1$-fractal curves, are indeed limits, in an appropriate sense, of spectral triples on the approximating sets. We answer this question affirmatively in this paper, where we use the spectral propinquity on the class of metric spectral triples, in order to formalize the sought-after convergence of spectral triples. Our results and methods are relevant to the study of analysis on fractals and have potential physical applications.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07676v1'>Bunce-Deddens algebras as quantum Gromov-Hausorff distance limits of circle algebras</a>,<br>Konrad Aguilar, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Latr&eacute;moli&egrave;re, Timothy Rainone,  <i>Integral Equations Operator Theory 94 (2022), no. 1, Paper No. 2, 42 pp</i>, ArXiv: <a class='arxiva' href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07676v1'>2008.07676v1</a><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p style='text-align: justify'>We show that Bunce-Deddens algebras, which are AT-algebras, are also limits of circle algebras for Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance, and moreover, form a continuous family indexed by the Baire space.

The method used a construction of Rieffel referred to as the "Heisenberg bimodule" in which the two noncommutative solenoid corresponds to two different twisted group algebras associated to dual lattices in $(\mathbb Q_p\times \mathbb R)^2.$ In this paper, we make three additional observations: first, that at each stage, the subalgebra given by the irrational rotation algebra corresponding to $α_{2j}=(θ+1)/p^{2j}$ is strongly Morita equivalent to the irrational rotation algebra corresponding to the irrational rotation algebra corresponding to $β_{2j}= 1-\frac{θ+1}{p^{2j}θ}$ by a different construction of Rieffel, secondly, that that Rieffel's Heisenberg module relating the two non commutative solenoids can be constructed as the closure of a nested sequence of function spaces associated to a multiresolution analysis for a $p$-adic wavelet, and finally, at each stage, the equivalence bimodule between $A_{α_{2j}}$ and $A_{β_{2j}}$ can be identified with the subequivalence bimodules arising from the $p$-adic MRA.

We prove that there are two main types of irreducible representations for the crossed-product: those whose restriction to A is irreducible and those who are the sum of two unitarily unequivalent representations of A. We characterize each class in term of the restriction of the representations to the fixed point C*-subalgebra of A. We apply our results to compute the K-theory of several crossed-products of the free group on two generators.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0610467v1'>The C*-algebra of symmetric words in two universal unitaries</a>,<br>Man-Duen Choi, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Latr&eacute;moli&egrave;re,  <i>Journal of Operator Theory 62 (2009) 1, pp. 159-169</i>, ArXiv: <a class='arxiva' href='http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0610467v1'>math/0610467v1</a><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p style='text-align: justify'>We compute the K-theory of the C*-algebra of symmetric words in two universal unitaries.

In this paper, we undertake the first step to generalize such results and constructions to locally compact quantum metric spaces. Our present work shows how to generalize the construction of the bounded-Lipschitz metric on the state space of a C*-algebra which need not be unital, such that the topology induced by this distance on the state space is the weak* topology. In doing so we obtain some results on a state space picture of the strict topology of a C*-algebra.</p></details></li><li class='lipublication'><a class='papertitle' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0310214v4'>Approximation of Quantum Tori by Finite Quantum Tori for the Quantum Gromov-Hausdorff Distance</a>,<br>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Latr&eacute;moli&egrave;re,  <i>Journal of Func.

In this paper, we show that indeed the quantum tori are limits of such finite dimensional C*-algebras for the quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance for compact quantum metric spaces introduced by Rieffel, when one chooses the right metric structures. The proof uses a mild extension of a result by Ramazan on continuous fields of C*-algebras obtained from groupoid C*-algebras, and extends on Rieffel's work on the continuity of the quantum tori for the quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance. We also show that one can collapse a quantum torus to a lower dimensional quantum torus.</p></details></li>
